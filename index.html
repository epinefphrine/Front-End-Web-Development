                Louisiana is commonly known as the Pelican State due to the large population of brown pelicans
                along its coastlines. Nestled in the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana's marshy waterways offer a fantastic 
                host for pelicans. Louisiana officially adopted the pelican as its state bird in 1966.
